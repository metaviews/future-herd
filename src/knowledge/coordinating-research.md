# **Policy Brief**

## **Building a Coordinated National Agri-Food Research System**

### **A Proposal for Mapping and Aligning Canada’s Agricultural Research, Innovation, and Commercialization Ecosystem**

**December 2025**

## **Executive Summary**

Canada’s agri-food research system is world-class but structurally fragmented. With hundreds of commodities, dozens of research institutions, multiple federal-provincial programs, and a mix of commodity groups and private actors, no national body has a comprehensive view of who is conducting which research, where investments are being made, or where critical gaps exist. This fragmentation weakens Canada’s capacity to respond to rising climate risks, trade volatility, biosecurity threats, and shifting global competition.

This brief outlines a practical, nation-wide proposal: the creation of a **coordinated, transparent map of Canada’s agricultural research and innovation landscape**. This “shared game board” would allow governments, institutions, and industry to see the full ecosystem, reduce duplication, prioritize investments, and strengthen long-term resilience across the food system.

## **The Challenge: A Fragmented and Opaque Research Landscape**

### **1. Multiple Jurisdictions, No Unified View**

Canada’s federal–provincial structure results in overlapping mandates and parallel programs. SCAP funding cycles impose rigid five-year boundaries that disrupt momentum, while provinces maintain separate research infrastructure and commodity-specific organizations. Nationally, no single body integrates:

- Government-funded academic research
- Provincial research farms and facilities
- Commodity boards and marketing agencies
- Non-profit research organizations
- Innovation hubs and accelerators
- Commercial R&D
- Producer-led on-farm trials

This leads to duplication, misalignment, and missed opportunities.

### **2. Loss of Research Momentum**

Long-term agricultural research requires continuity. SCAP’s five-year cycle frequently delays project start-up, shortens execution timelines, and forces premature closure of initiatives that require a decade or more. Even small budget reductions can eliminate dozens of research projects, many of which will never be restarted. Momentum lost now will constrain Canada’s future competitiveness.

### **3. Emerging Risks Demand Coordination**

Canada faces escalating pressures on its domestic food system:

- Climate change altering growing conditions
- Evolving pests and diseases
- Supply chain instability
- Declining U.S. public investment in agricultural research
- Critical infrastructure gaps
- Increasing costs and labour shortages
- Rapid advances in digital tools, automation, and AI

These challenges cannot be managed effectively through siloed decision-making or institution-by-institution planning.

### **4. Structural Barriers to Innovation**

Canada’s commercialization ecosystem remains inconsistent across regions and commodities. Without visibility into where innovations originate or get stuck, it is difficult to design effective supports. Compounding this, competitive pressures discourage processors and private firms from sharing data that would otherwise help elevate sector-wide performance.

## **The Proposal: A National Agri-Food Research & Innovation Map**

### **1. What the Map Would Contain**

A pan-Canadian coordination system should track:

- All government-funded research projects (federal & provincial)
- Major research infrastructure and facilities
- Institutional areas of expertise
- Commodity-specific priorities
- Innovation and commercialization pathways
- Funding allocations and timelines
- Cross-sector partnerships
- Identified overlaps and gaps

This would not replace existing bodies but give them visibility into the whole ecosystem.

### **2. How It Would Work**

Each major actor places its “chips” on the shared game board:

- **Federal government**: SCAP programs, AAFC research stations, national priorities.
- **Provinces**: regional research priorities, research farms, infrastructure investments.
- **Academic institutions**: active research clusters, facilities, grant-funded work.
- **Commodity groups**: sector priorities, levy-funded projects, industry roadmaps.
- **Non-profits and NGOs**: knowledge mobilization, extension, KTT.
- **Industry**: innovation investments, commercialization partnerships.

A coordinating body—federal or arm’s length—maintains the map, updates it annually, and ensures national visibility.

### **3. Governance Options**

The coordinating body could be:

- A new national research coordination secretariat
- An expansion of an existing AAFC knowledge platform
- A federal–provincial consortium model
- An independent non-profit supported by governments and industry

The key requirement is neutrality and broad sectoral legitimacy.

## **Expected Benefits**

### **1. Strategic Investment & Efficiency**

- Reduce duplication across provinces and institutions
- Prioritize long-term, nationally significant research
- Improve allocation of SCAP and AAFC funds
- Identify gaps before crises force reactive spending

### **2. Innovation Acceleration**

- Improve commercialization pathways
- Strengthen industry-research linkages
- Support faster adoption of climate-ready varieties
- Increase collaboration across regions and commodities

### **3. National Food System Resilience**

- Better anticipate climate, pest, and biosecurity risks
- Strengthen domestic supply chains
- Reduce dependence on foreign research capacity
- Support food security and sovereignty objectives

### **4. Knowledge Mobilization & Accessibility**

- Lower barriers for smaller sectors and emerging commodities
- Improve extension and outreach
- Enable researchers to build on existing work
- Provide clear entry points for students, entrepreneurs, and innovators

---

## **Implementation Pathway**

### **Phase 1 — Scoping & Landscape Audit (6–12 months)**

- Inventory existing research programs, facilities, and priorities nationwide
- Identify key actors, data sources, and gaps
- Develop a taxonomy for the national map

### **Phase 2 — Prototype & Stakeholder Validation (12 months)**

- Build a pilot platform
- Populate with data from willing provinces and institutions
- Conduct consultations with producers, researchers, and policymakers

### **Phase 3 — National Rollout (24 months)**

- Expand coverage to full national scope
- Formalize governance and long-term funding
- Integrate into federal and provincial planning cycles

### **Phase 4 — Continuous Coordination**

- Annual updates synchronized with SCAP reporting
- Ongoing integration of new research streams
- Active monitoring for duplication, gaps, and emerging priorities

## **Conclusion**

Canada’s agri-food research ecosystem is strong, but fragmented. Without a national coordination mechanism, the country risks falling behind in innovation, resilience, and long-term competitiveness. A shared research and innovation map—maintained by a neutral coordinating body—would provide the visibility, continuity, and strategic alignment the sector urgently needs.

This proposal is not a call for new bureaucracy, but a call for clarity: a way to see the full system so Canada can plan for the future rather than react to it.

A coordinated research map is the foundation for a resilient, innovative, and future-ready Canadian food system.
