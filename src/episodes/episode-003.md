## Overview

In this episode, we speak with Doug Reddick, Director of the Research and Innovation Branch at Ontario’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agribusiness. We start with the fundamentals—why agricultural research demands long-term commitment, and how climate volatility, biosecurity threats, and trade disruption raise the stakes for Canada’s food system. But the core of the conversation is Doug’s diagnosis of a deeper structural problem: Canada’s agri-food research and innovation landscape is fragmented and, in key ways, unmapped—making coordination and long-term strategy far harder than they need to be.

## Key themes

- Canada needs a shared “game board”: a national map of agri-food research, innovation, and commercialization to reduce duplication and expose gaps.
- Research is early-stage risk management: proactive investment is cheaper than reacting after crop loss, disease outbreaks, or supply chain shocks.
- Short funding cycles undermine long-term outcomes: continuity matters, and momentum is difficult to rebuild once lost.
- Data sharing is uneven: supply-managed sectors can be more transparent, while processors often treat performance data as competitive advantage.
- Leadership is a coordination problem: the work isn’t only technical—it’s institutional, cross-jurisdictional, and political.

## Guests

Doug Reddick is the Director of the Research and Innovation Branch at Ontario’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Agribusiness. His work spans research programming, major institutional agreements, and oversight of research infrastructure—giving him a rare system-level view of how agricultural knowledge is funded, organized, and put into practice.

## Notes

This episode is accompanied by a short policy brief summarizing Doug’s proposal for a coordinated national research map. If you’re a producer, policymaker, researcher, funder, or sector leader, consider the brief a discussion starter: what would it take for Canada to see its agri-food research ecosystem clearly—and to coordinate it well enough to meet the next 25 years?
