Guest: Ruth Knight, Agriculture Adaptation Council Director and Chair of the Agri-Food 2050 committee

How do you build a sector capable of welcoming the unknown? This conversation explores how curiosity, dialogue, patience, and imagination can reshape the culture of Ontario’s agri-food system. Together we examine why future readiness begins with mindset, and why the long-term resilience of the sector depends on creating space for diverse voices, intergenerational exchange, and emergent ways of thinking.

## **Strategic Mindsets for 2050: A Leadership Brief**

A future-ready agri-food sector depends less on predicting what comes next and more on cultivating the mindsets that allow organizations to meet uncertainty with confidence, creativity, and resilience. The conversation with Ruth Knight highlights a shift from control to emergence, from rigid problem-solving to a more dynamic practice of curiosity, dialogue, and shared learning.

Leaders who embrace curiosity expand the range of possibilities their organizations can see. Curiosity reframes uncertainty as an opportunity for discovery rather than a threat. It encourages experimentation, invites diverse perspectives, and helps teams remain open to futures they cannot yet articulate.

Cultivating patience is equally essential. Patience allows organizations to work on long-term transformation rather than chase immediate clarity. It supports deeper conversations, better listening, and the emotional capacity to navigate disagreement. Patience is not slowness; it is steadiness in the face of complexity.

Dialogue is the core mechanism through which these mindsets take shape. Not debate, not consensus-forcing, but dialogue: structured spaces where people listen generously, speak from experience, and explore ideas without rushing to solutions. Dialogue strengthens community, builds trust, and allows new patterns of thinking to emerge.

Imagination and play are strategic assets. In a sector conditioned toward efficiency and risk-avoidance, play creates safe spaces for testing ideas, stretching mental models, and activating creative capacities often left dormant. Imagination expands the boundaries of what leaders consider possible and makes innovation less accidental and more intentional.

Intergenerational engagement is not optional. Young people face steeper barriers than previous generations and bring forms of insight the sector urgently needs. Their perspectives challenge inherited assumptions and bring fresh approaches to problem-solving, technology, risk, and culture. Supporting them requires not only opportunities but meaningful power.

A shift toward emergence is the overarching mindset. Instead of trying to control outcomes, leaders can focus on creating the right conditions for desired outcomes to arise. This means loosening rigid structures, embracing adaptive planning, nurturing diversity of ideas, and recognizing that cultural change happens through repeated, inclusive practice.

A future-ready agri-food system is one where curiosity is encouraged, patience is practiced, dialogue is ongoing, imagination is valued, young people are empowered, and emergence guides strategy. These mindsets are not peripheral; they are the infrastructure of resilience and the foundation for the next generation of leadership.
