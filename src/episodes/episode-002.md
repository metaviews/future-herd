Guest: Ruth Knight, Agriculture Adaptation Council Director and Chair of the Agri-Food 2050 committee

Together we examine why future readiness begins with mindset, and why the long-term resilience of the sector depends on creating space for diverse voices, intergenerational exchange, and emergent ways of thinking.
