## Overview

The agri-food sector can’t automate its way into the future without people. In this conversation, Jesse Hirsh speaks with Jennifer Wright of the Canadian Agricultural Human Resource Council about what it takes to build the workforce that can actually adopt—and benefit from—automation, AI, robotics, and digital systems.

Jennifer brings a practical perspective shaped by national workforce planning: the importance of collaboration across industry and education, the role of micro-credentials and hybrid training, and the hard question that follows every future-facing convening—what now, and how do we turn vision into visible progress?

## Key themes
- Workforce capacity as the limiting factor for innovation: technology depends on skills, training, and retention
- Collaboration as infrastructure: aligning industry, educators, and partners to avoid duplication and misfit programs
- A hybrid training ecosystem: micro-credentials, on-the-job learning, remote delivery, and emerging tools like VR
- From conversation to action: short-term deliverables, iterative planning, and accountability that sustains momentum

## Guests

Jennifer Wright is with the Canadian Agricultural Human Resource Council (CAHRC). She works at the intersection of workforce strategy, skills development, and sector readiness—focused on the partnerships and training systems needed to support agriculture and food manufacturing as technologies and roles evolve.

## Notes

This episode pairs long-term thinking (2050) with near-term urgency: workforce shortages, rapid technological change, and the need for tangible “next steps” that keep collaborative efforts moving. If you’re working in industry, education, policy, or regional planning, consider using the companion handout of strategic questions to guide internal discussions and partnership-building.
