        The Future Herd is a podcast about leadership, adaptation, and collective intelligence in an age of uncertainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each episode is a conversation with people working inside food systems, agriculture, policy, technology, and community—people navigating long-term change without a script. Rather than focusing on prediction, the show explores how futures are shaped through collaboration, negotiation, and lived experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name reflects the premise: the future is not led by a single authority, but by many independent actors adapting together.

<section class="context">
  <p>
    As food systems, institutions, and communities face accelerating disruption, simple narratives and centralized solutions increasingly fail. The Future Herd creates space for slower thinking, critical reflection, and dialogue across disciplines—grounded in practice rather than hype.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are interested in how decisions are made under pressure, how authority is earned rather than assumed, and how collaboration becomes a form of leadership, this podcast is for you.

    Many independent actors. Adapting together.
