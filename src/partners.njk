  <p>
    The Future Herd is built as a collaborative media project: a place where sector leaders can think out loud, compare notes across the value chain, and make long-range resilience feel practical.
  </p>

  <p>
    Partnerships matter because the future of agri-food won’t be “delivered” by a single organization, technology, or policy lever. It will be shaped by networks that can hold complexity, learn in public, and translate foresight into action.
  </p>

  <h2>Our founding partner: Agricultural Adaptation Council (AAC)</h2>

  <p>
    The Agricultural Adaptation Council (AAC) is an industry-led, not-for-profit organization that supports innovation and collaboration across Ontario’s agri-food sector through program delivery, connections, and strategic partnerships.
  </p>

  <p>
    AAC is our founding partner because they sit in a rare position: they work across the full value chain, they’re already trusted as a sector convenor, and they have deep experience turning ideas into real-world programs. In other words: The Future Herd can host the conversation, but AAC helps ensure the conversation stays connected to the institutions, funding pathways, and implementation realities that shape what’s possible.
  </p>

  <h2>The Agri-Food 2050 process</h2>
    <img class="partner-logo__img" src="/assets/img/AgriFood2050_SecondaryLogo_Colour_Web.png" alt="Agricultural Adaptation Council (AAC) logo">

  <p>
    Agri-Food 2050 is AAC’s sector-wide foresight initiative to help Ontario’s agri-food value chain adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world. The process is designed to catalyze connections across the sector, build shared understanding through learning and knowledge-sharing, and support action by informing priorities for policy, programming, and investment.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Future Herd exists as a public-facing extension of this work: a living record of how leaders reason together—across uncertainty—while pressure-testing assumptions and surfacing tradeoffs.
  </p>

  <h2>What partners do (practically)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Nominate and connect guests across the value chain (including perspectives that rarely get airtime).</li>
    <li>Bring applied research and field insights into the conversation.</li>
    <li>Help translate episodes into supplementary briefs, reading lists, and action prompts.</li>
    <li>Extend reach through cross-promotion and distribution.</li>
    <li>Support event programming (live salons, roundtables, workshops).</li>
    <li>Sponsor production so episodes can be released faster and more frequently.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why we welcome additional partners and sponsors</h2>

  <p>
    Agri-food resilience is a shared challenge that crosses institutions. Additional partners and sponsors let us do three things better:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Increase representation</strong>: more voices, more regions, more commodities, more roles—especially those closest to operational realities.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve usefulness</strong>: better prep, better follow-up, better supporting materials, and tighter links between conversation and action.</li>
    <li><strong>Build foresight literacy</strong>: not hype, not prediction—practical shared capacity for anticipating change together.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    If your organization is aligned with collaboration, resilience, and real-world problem-solving, we’d love to talk.
